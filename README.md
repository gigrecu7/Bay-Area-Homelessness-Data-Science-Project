# Bay-Area-Homelessness-Data-Science-Project
For this project I have 2 files of code. The Data exploration: provide descriptive statistics of the dataset exploring patterns, relationships, basic statistics, visualizations, etc.
Based on your findings in step 1, state interesting research questions and objectives or hypotheses. For example, specific homeless program can reduce recidivism for homeless population with certain ethnicity.
Develop models (predictive, decision trees, multiple regressions, etc.) to test your hypotheses or research questions/objectives from step 2
Conclusion: provide summary of your recommendations and insights based on steps 1-3.
